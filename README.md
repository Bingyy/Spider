# Spider

Or we can call it a much cooler legal name: WebScraper. Finally, I am investing some time to dig in how to build my own spider as an assistant. Here I am going to upload the files generated within the period I am learning.

The book is 《Web Scraping with Python》which is written by Ryan Mitchell。

The file can be accessed via this link:

Yes, the "planet" is not for free, it is about quant trading. And the motivation for me to dig in spider is that i need more data to analyze. If you are interested in auto-trading, maybe we can talk in some way. I can invite you as my guest to join my planet, yes ,for free.
